# Roadmap

- **`/hygiene` — Codebase entropy scanner** — Mechanical scan for dead code, doc drift, orphaned artifacts. Periodic audit, not pre-push. See [brainstorm](docs/design/hygiene/brainstorm.md).

- **`/arch-review` — Architecture coherence review** — Top-down review for wrong boundaries, feature incoherence, pattern inconsistencies, tech stack misfits. The "bash calling python calling bash" detector. See [brainstorm](docs/design/arch-review/brainstorm.md).

- **`/landscape` — External research and industry comparison** — Web-search-based research skill. Answers questions `/arch-review` raises by checking standards, community practice, alternatives, and sustainability. See [brainstorm](docs/design/landscape/brainstorm.md).

- **`/project-success` — Project success factors review** — Evaluate what makes a project take off and stay useful. Not just what's missing but what's working, what could be stronger, and what separates projects that thrive from ones that stall. Onboarding experience, API clarity, documentation quality, test confidence, community readiness, architectural resilience. Relationship to other review skills TBD. See [brainstorm](docs/design/project-success/brainstorm.md).

- **Portable AI conventions** — Template of CLAUDE.md rules seeded into new projects via `/bootstrap`. Lessons from AI-assisted development turned into active rules, not a passive playbook. See [brainstorm](docs/design/ai-conventions/brainstorm.md).

- **AI workflow guide** — Human-readable reference for people learning to work effectively with AI coding assistants. Shareable with coworkers. Practical problem/solution format, grouped by topic. See [brainstorm](docs/design/ai-guide/brainstorm.md).
