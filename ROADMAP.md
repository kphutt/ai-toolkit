# Roadmap

## Next

- **Skill orchestration** — Meta-skill that chains other skills (e.g., `/preflight` → `/commit` → push). Needs a way to pass context between skill invocations.

- **Cross-platform AI CLI support** — Adapt skills/hooks for Gemini CLI and OpenAI CLI alongside Claude Code. Identify shared abstractions vs. CLI-specific wiring.

- **Mac ~/dev/ standardization** — Mirror the Windows `~/dev/` layout on macOS. Document any platform-specific setup steps (Homebrew, symlink behavior, shell differences).
