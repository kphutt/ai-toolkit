# /project-success — Project Success Factors Review

Evaluate what makes a project take off and stay useful. Not "what's broken" (that's /hygiene) or "is the architecture sound" (that's /arch-review), but "does this project have what it takes to succeed?"

## Core question

If someone found this project tomorrow, would they understand it, trust it, use it, and contribute to it? If the maintainer disappeared for six months, would the project survive?

## Possible dimensions

Placeholder — needs real brainstorming. Initial thoughts on what to evaluate:

- **First impression** — README clarity, time from clone to running, install friction
- **Trust signals** — Test quality and coverage in critical paths, CI status, release cadence
- **API/interface clarity** — Can users figure out how to use this without reading source code?
- **Documentation quality** — Not just "does it exist" but "does it answer the questions people actually have?"
- **Resilience** — Bus factor, knowledge distribution, dependency health
- **Community readiness** — Contributing guide, issue templates, license, code of conduct
- **Momentum** — Is the project actively maintained? Are roadmap items progressing?

## Open questions

- How does this relate to `/arch-review`, `/hygiene`, and `/landscape`? Is there overlap or are they cleanly complementary?
- Is this one skill or multiple? "Project success" is broad.
- Should this produce a score, a report, or recommendations?
- Should it compare against successful open-source projects as a benchmark?
