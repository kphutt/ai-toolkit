# Code Review Prompt

Drop this into a CLAUDE.md or use it as a prompt template when reviewing code.

---

Review this code for:

1. **Bugs** — anything that would break at runtime
2. **Clarity** — could another dev understand this in 30 seconds?
3. **Edge cases** — what inputs would make this fail?

Skip style nits. Only flag things that matter. For each issue, show the fix, not just the problem.
