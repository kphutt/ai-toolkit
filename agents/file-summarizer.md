# File Summarizer Agent

A basic agent that reads a file and produces a one-paragraph plain-English summary of what it does.

## Usage

Give it a file path. It reads the file and explains what it does like you're telling a coworker over coffee.

## Prompt

```
Read the file at the given path. Write a single paragraph (3-5 sentences) explaining what this file does in plain English. No jargon unless absolutely necessary. If it's a config file, explain what it configures. If it's code, explain the behavior, not the syntax.
```
